<p>DevOpsDays PDX - Best Vends: The How + Why to Befriend Your Vendor</p>

<p>If you are on the “buy” side of build versus buy this talk is for you! By buying a vendor’s product you are inviting them to be a part of your team and your platform - why not make the most out of your investment? From participating in betas to simply reading vendor emails I will give you a dazzling array of activities you can do today to start on the path of becoming best vends.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/271452246" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The tl;dr is “how microservices can better facilitate communication between team members and from team to team”.</p>

<p>Adopting microservices means a shift in architecture of our system and in communication. Letting your upstream and downstream dependencies know of major changes is not just a courtesy but required in order to keep things moving. Communicating early and often takes shape in strategies like versioning, informative deprecation warnings, temporarily providing backwards compatibility can all help enforce the coming changes.</p>

<p>This type of content seems straightforward so I’ll take the approach of “do this not that” and look at realistic examples such as: during active development a team picks up your work and suddenly becomes a dependency - how do you gracefully communicate constant changes? Or its endpoint deprecation day and you still have active consumers - how to provide the tools they need to migrate to the new stuff. Or the nuts and bolts of why and how keeping documentation up to date will add to your daily productivity.</p>

<h2 id="girls-have-it-day-keynote">Girls Have IT Day - Keynote</h2>

<p>The story of my path from middle school to software engineering. Reviewed just a few of the different disciplines within engineering and underscored the idea that engineers are creators and problem solvers that need lots of skills like reading, writing, teamwork and listening. Presented at Girls Have IT Day, a single day event for middle school girls to explore STEAM pathways.</p>

<h2 id="devopsdayspdx-disposable-infrastructure-you-only-build-me-up-to-tear-me-down">DevOpsDaysPDX - Disposable Infrastructure: You Only Build Me Up To Tear Me Down</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz6dfXhvYaY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I’ll start with my definition of disposable infrastructure, “Automating the process of provisioning, configuring, deploying, and tearing down cloud infrastructure and services.”. Essentially 1 script to go from 0 to live application and from live application back to 0 again.</p>

<p>Then talk through and show the code for each major step the program is running through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading in the configuration file describing the desired infrastructure and set up (1 service per instance)</li>
<li>Generating a plan and invoking Terraform to provision EC2 instances, security groups, load balancers, and a database</li>
<li>Generating a playbook and running Ansible to configure each instance according to what service is running on it</li>
<li>Packaging the deployed environment</li>
</ul>
